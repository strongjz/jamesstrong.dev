      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases,&#xA;updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial&#xA;Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There&#xA;is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work. DeepRacer&#xA;has to be the new wow release, another physical device for ML following the release last year of DeepLens. DeepRacer&#xA;is a machine learning car that is programmed with simple python scripts. There is even a league now that customers&#xA;can participate in at AWS events culminating in a championship at re:Invent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
