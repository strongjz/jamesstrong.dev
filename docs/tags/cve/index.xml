      <description>Are you using container images with hundreds of known vulnerabilities?
The majority of us are using images based on the Docker official images available on the Docker Hub. This includes base images – such as Debian and Ubuntu – as well as application images such as nginx and redis.

This security debt can lead to unnecessary security risks and slower development cycles.</description>

In 7 years, Ingress-nginx has had 221 releases, with over 6800 commits. To ensure stability and to test this highly configurable controller, the project has grown to over 400 e2e tests and helm chart tests across various kubernetes versions and deployment landscapes.
