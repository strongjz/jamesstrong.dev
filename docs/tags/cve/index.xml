      <description>Are you using container images with hundreds of known vulnerabilities?&#xA;The majority of us are using images based on the Docker official images available on the Docker Hub. This includes base images – such as Debian and Ubuntu – as well as application images such as nginx and redis.

This security debt can lead to unnecessary security risks and slower development cycles.</description>

Although basic capabilities are provided by Git service providers, more granular controls for governance and compliance are a requirement to satisfy most enterprise grade implementations.</description>
