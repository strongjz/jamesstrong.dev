      <description>Are you using container images with hundreds of known vulnerabilities?
The majority of us are using images based on the Docker official images available on the Docker Hub. This includes base images – such as Debian and Ubuntu – as well as application images such as nginx and redis. Unfortunately these images often have hundreds of known vulnerabilities due to excessively large dependency trees with out-of-date packages. This security debt can lead to unnecessary security risks and slower development cycles.</description>

      <description>Life of a CVE with Ingress-Nginx; Understanding the Project&amp;rsquo;s Release Cycle - James Strong, Chainguard &amp;amp; Dylen Turnbull, Nginx INC
Speakers: Dylen Turnbull, James Strong
In 7 years, Ingress-nginx has had 221 releases, with over 6800 commits. To ensure stability and to test this highly configurable controller, the project has grown to over 400 e2e tests and helm chart tests across various kubernetes versions and deployment landscapes. We were 3/4 through our stabilization project in the last maintainer track we presented.</description>

      <description>Understanding the Future of Ingress-nginx - James Strong, Chainguard &amp;amp; Ricardo Katz, VMware
Speakers: Ricardo Katz, James Strong
In this talk, we will present the survey results from our Ingress-nginx community survey. The survey&amp;rsquo;s goal was to know what we should be doing for future releases and how to prioritize features, bugs, or other issues important to the community. The ingress-nginx project is undergoing a stabilization project as well. This stabilization project has worked to increase the security, review and deprecate older features, and fix long-standing issues with the project.</description>

      <description>The Chainguard team has released a new whitepaper titled “All About That Base Image.” The whitepaper proposes “quiet” base images, minimal images with few or no security vulnerabilities, and other security features built-in.
The intended audience is software development teams that use containers and are interested in reducing the workload associated with investigating and mitigating security vulnerabilities. The whitepaper helps software professionals better understand the security debt of popular base images by analyzing the number, severity, and lifetime of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>This past year Vallery Lancey and I have been working on a Kubernetes Networking Book.
I am proud to announce that we have an early release of Chapters 1-3 of the book available on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Digital platform.
Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.
Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack&amp;ndash;the network, operating system, and Kubernetes&amp;ndash;depends on the layer below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last year created a course for A Cloud Guru. With 3.4 hours of content and 36 lessons, I look forward to your feedback. Here is my &amp;ldquo;Advanced Networking with Kubernetes on AWS&amp;rdquo; Course.
Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed.</description>

      <description>At the August meetup for Atlanta AWS Builders group Jason Lutz and I presented on AWS Security.
Presentation: https://www.slideshare.net/jstrong09/aws-dev-secops-atlanta-august-meetup
Is that requirement from NIST 800-53 Controls or NIST 800-190? If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered where those pesky cloud security controls come from, this meetup is for you. In this Meetup, Jame Strong and Jason Lutz from Contino (an AWS Permier Consulting Partner) will discuss how Contino views DevSecOps. They will review the Benefits of DevSecOps:</description>

      <description>DevOps is established, and containers are all the rage, but we forget about security!
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about DevSecOps and Containers. We&amp;rsquo;re going to show you how to inject security into your Container Pipelines. Don&amp;rsquo;t have a pipeline? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, because we&amp;rsquo;ll fix that too.
In this talk, James Strong, Cloud Native Director at Contino and AWS APN Ambassador, will share knowledge around container security and building a DevSecOps pipeline in AWS with no servers.</description>

      <description>KubeCon San Diego Recap
KubeCon had a great turnout this year with 12,000 attendees that filled the San Diego Convention center. Three things stood out to me: Security, Network, and Community.
The community was a big theme at this event and in many of the keynotes. From David’s talk about non-code ways to contribute to CNCF’s projects. Kelsey Hightower’s keynote on how we could never have done this as an individual or a single company.</description>

      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>

In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.
Running Rules for CI/CD AWS Tool 1. Maintain a code repository Commit 2. Automate the build * 3. Keep the build fast Build 4. Make the build self-testing Deploy 5. Commit early, commit often Commit 6.</description>
