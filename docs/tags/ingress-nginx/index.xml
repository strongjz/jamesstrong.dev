In this session we will discuss how the ingress-nginx controller works, how it differs from the NGINX inc controller, the release process, and how you can help contribute to the project!</description>

In 7 years, Ingress-nginx has had 221 releases, with over 6800 commits. To ensure stability and to test this highly configurable controller, the project has grown to over 400 e2e tests and helm chart tests across various kubernetes versions and deployment landscapes.

      <description>Understanding the Future of Ingress-nginx - James Strong, Chainguard &amp;amp; Ricardo Katz, VMware
Speakers: Ricardo Katz, James Strong
In this talk, we will present the survey results from our Ingress-nginx community survey. The survey&amp;rsquo;s goal was to know what we should be doing for future releases and how to prioritize features, bugs, or other issues important to the community. The ingress-nginx project is undergoing a stabilization project as well. This stabilization project has worked to increase the security, review and deprecate older features, and fix long-standing issues with the project.</description>
