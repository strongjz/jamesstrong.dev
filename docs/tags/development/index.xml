      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.&#xA;The first thing that caught my attention was this question:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>
