      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>On December 29th I completed my final goal of the year - I passed the CKA.
TL;DR This is a list of the bare minimum necessary to try to pass.
Do Kelsey Hightowerâ€™s tutorial Kubernetes The Hard Way at least three times! Understand it, internalize it. Do all the tasks on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ Read Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa Also practice, practice, and practice. Did I mention practice? This is a practical exam, no multiple choice questions here.</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>
