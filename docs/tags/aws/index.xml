      <description>This past year Vallery Lancey and I have been working on a Kubernetes Networking Book.
I am proud to announce that we have an early release of Chapters 1-3 of the book available on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Digital platform.
Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.
Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack&amp;ndash;the network, operating system, and Kubernetes&amp;ndash;depends on the layer below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last year created a course for A Cloud Guru. With 3.4 hours of content and 36 lessons, I look forward to your feedback. Here is my &amp;ldquo;Advanced Networking with Kubernetes on AWS&amp;rdquo; Course.
Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed.</description>

      <description>At the August meetup for Atlanta AWS Builders group Jason Lutz and I presented on AWS Security.
Presentation: https://www.slideshare.net/jstrong09/aws-dev-secops-atlanta-august-meetup
Is that requirement from NIST 800-53 Controls or NIST 800-190? If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered where those pesky cloud security controls come from, this meetup is for you. In this Meetup, Jame Strong and Jason Lutz from Contino (an AWS Permier Consulting Partner) will discuss how Contino views DevSecOps. They will review the Benefits of DevSecOps:</description>

      <description>DevOps is established, and containers are all the rage, but we forget about security!
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about DevSecOps and Containers. We&amp;rsquo;re going to show you how to inject security into your Container Pipelines. Don&amp;rsquo;t have a pipeline? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, because we&amp;rsquo;ll fix that too.
In this talk, James Strong, Cloud Native Director at Contino and AWS APN Ambassador, will share knowledge around container security and building a DevSecOps pipeline in AWS with no servers.</description>

      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>

      <description>This talk was presented in 2017 at Louisville Local Software Development Conference Codepalousa.
In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.
Running Rules for CI/CD AWS Tool 1. Maintain a code repository Commit 2. Automate the build * 3. Keep the build fast Build 4. Make the build self-testing Deploy 5. Commit early, commit often Commit 6.</description>
