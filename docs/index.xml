      <description>This past year Vallery Lancey and I have been working on a Kubernetes Networking Book.
I am proud to announce that we have an early release of Chapters 1-3 of the book available on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Digital platform.
Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.
Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack&amp;ndash;the network, operating system, and Kubernetes&amp;ndash;depends on the layer below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last year created a course for A Cloud Guru. With 3.4 hours of content and 36 lessons, I look forward to your feedback. Here is my &amp;ldquo;Advanced Networking with Kubernetes on AWS&amp;rdquo; Course.
Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed.</description>

      <description>At the August meetup for Atlanta AWS Builders group Jason Lutz and I presented on AWS Security.
Presentation: https://www.slideshare.net/jstrong09/aws-dev-secops-atlanta-august-meetup
Is that requirement from NIST 800-53 Controls or NIST 800-190? If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered where those pesky cloud security controls come from, this meetup is for you. In this Meetup, Jame Strong and Jason Lutz from Contino (an AWS Permier Consulting Partner) will discuss how Contino views DevSecOps. They will review the Benefits of DevSecOps:</description>

      <description>KubeCon San Diego Recap
KubeCon had a great turnout this year with 12,000 attendees that filled the San Diego Convention center. Three things stood out to me: Security, Network, and Community.
The community was a big theme at this event and in many of the keynotes. From David’s talk about non-code ways to contribute to CNCF’s projects. Kelsey Hightower’s keynote on how we could never have done this as an individual or a single company.</description>

      <description>Another year! Another amazing Code PaLOUsa come and gone.
Location This year Code PaLOUsa was at the Hyatt Regency, which is smack dap in the middle of downtown. This location makes it a perfect spot for all the speakers and conference-goers to experience some of the tourist spots in Louisville and still enjoy the conference.
Sessions The sessions were action-packed, as well. A (useful?) attribute of a conference is the level of difficulty for goers to decide which speakers to see!</description>

      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.

      <description>On December 29th I completed my final goal of the year - I passed the CKA.
TL;DR This is a list of the bare minimum necessary to try to pass.
 Do Kelsey Hightower’s tutorial Kubernetes The Hard Way at least three times! Understand it, internalize it. Do all the tasks on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ Read Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa  Also practice, practice, and practice. Did I mention practice? This is a practical exam, no multiple choice questions here.</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>

      <description>Before we dive into some of the highlights from DockerCon 2017, let’s do a quick overview of what Docker is. Quite simply, a “docker container” is a portable container, of sorts, that allows a collection of apps to run on any operating system.
How is it possible, you ask, for a docker container to allow any app to “Build, Ship and Run,” as the docker motto says, on any OS? A docker container uses kernel features to produce resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O and more) as well as separate namespaces, to isolate the application’s view of the operating system (a visual depiction below).</description>

In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.
   Running Rules for CI/CD AWS Tool     1. Maintain a code repository Commit   2. Automate the build *   3. Keep the build fast Build   4.</description>
