      <description>Are you using container images with hundreds of known vulnerabilities?
The majority of us are using images based on the Docker official images available on the Docker Hub. This includes base images – such as Debian and Ubuntu – as well as application images such as nginx and redis. Unfortunately these images often have hundreds of known vulnerabilities due to excessively large dependency trees with out-of-date packages. This security debt can lead to unnecessary security risks and slower development cycles.</description>

      <description>ingress-nginx is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It&amp;rsquo;s not the NGINX inc controller&amp;hellip; confusing, right? In this session we will discuss how the ingress-nginx controller works, how it differs from the NGINX inc controller, the release process, and how you can help contribute to the project!</description>

      <description>One of the key values of GitOps relies on its fully declarative single source of truth in Git for the desired state of your entire system – configuration that continuously reconciles with the runtime of the system.
Validating committer identity in your Git repository is a critical component towards a secure GitOps solution. Although basic capabilities are provided by Git service providers, more granular controls for governance and compliance are a requirement to satisfy most enterprise grade implementations.</description>

      <description>Life of a CVE with Ingress-Nginx; Understanding the Project&amp;rsquo;s Release Cycle - James Strong, Chainguard &amp;amp; Dylen Turnbull, Nginx INC
Speakers: Dylen Turnbull, James Strong
In 7 years, Ingress-nginx has had 221 releases, with over 6800 commits. To ensure stability and to test this highly configurable controller, the project has grown to over 400 e2e tests and helm chart tests across various kubernetes versions and deployment landscapes. We were 3/4 through our stabilization project in the last maintainer track we presented.</description>

      <description>Cosign, fulcio, rekor are all components in keyless signing with Sigstore. Each piece has its responsibility to provide a smooth developer experience for container signing. How does it all work together to complete that complicated dance to tie identity to cryptographic signatures? And what&amp;rsquo;s more cryptic than rugby? In this talk, James and Lewis will educate attendees about sigstore and container signing using examples from the best sport in the world, rugby.</description>

      <description>Understanding the Future of Ingress-nginx - James Strong, Chainguard &amp;amp; Ricardo Katz, VMware
Speakers: Ricardo Katz, James Strong
In this talk, we will present the survey results from our Ingress-nginx community survey. The survey&amp;rsquo;s goal was to know what we should be doing for future releases and how to prioritize features, bugs, or other issues important to the community. The ingress-nginx project is undergoing a stabilization project as well. This stabilization project has worked to increase the security, review and deprecate older features, and fix long-standing issues with the project.</description>

      <description>The Chainguard team has released a new whitepaper titled “All About That Base Image.” The whitepaper proposes “quiet” base images, minimal images with few or no security vulnerabilities, and other security features built-in.
The intended audience is software development teams that use containers and are interested in reducing the workload associated with investigating and mitigating security vulnerabilities. The whitepaper helps software professionals better understand the security debt of popular base images by analyzing the number, severity, and lifetime of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>Things got a little tense on this week&amp;rsquo;s podcast when James Strong (@strongjz, Co-Author of O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Networking &amp;amp; Kubernetes) hinted at DR being a thing of the past with K8s. Mr. Backups was having none of that. No blows were thrown, mostly because it was all online, but it was a really good conversation that K8s and DR enthusiasts alike will find interesting. We also cover the new book, Networking and Kubernetes, by James Strong and Vallery Lancey, including why the decided to write it, and what it covers.</description>

I am proud to announce that we have an early release of Chapters 1-3 of the book available on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Digital platform.
Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.
Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack&amp;ndash;the network, operating system, and Kubernetes&amp;ndash;depends on the layer below.</description>

Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed.</description>

KubeCon had a great turnout this year with 12,000 attendees that filled the San Diego Convention center. Three things stood out to me: Security, Network, and Community.
The community was a big theme at this event and in many of the keynotes. From David’s talk about non-code ways to contribute to CNCF’s projects. Kelsey Hightower’s keynote on how we could never have done this as an individual or a single company.</description>

Location This year Code PaLOUsa was at the Hyatt Regency, which is smack dap in the middle of downtown. This location makes it a perfect spot for all the speakers and conference-goers to experience some of the tourist spots in Louisville and still enjoy the conference.
Sessions The sessions were action-packed, as well. A (useful?) attribute of a conference is the level of difficulty for goers to decide which speakers to see!</description>

      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&amp;rsquo;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.

      <description>On December 29th I completed my final goal of the year - I passed the CKA.
TL;DR This is a list of the bare minimum necessary to try to pass.
Do Kelsey Hightower’s tutorial Kubernetes The Hard Way at least three times! Understand it, internalize it. Do all the tasks on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ Read Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa Also practice, practice, and practice. Did I mention practice? This is a practical exam, no multiple choice questions here.</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>

      <description>Before we dive into some of the highlights from DockerCon 2017, let’s do a quick overview of what Docker is. Quite simply, a “docker container” is a portable container, of sorts, that allows a collection of apps to run on any operating system.
How is it possible, you ask, for a docker container to allow any app to “Build, Ship and Run,” as the docker motto says, on any OS? A docker container uses kernel features to produce resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O and more) as well as separate namespaces, to isolate the application’s view of the operating system (a visual depiction below).</description>

      <description>This talk was presented in 2017 at Louisville Local Software Development Conference Codepalousa.
In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.
Running Rules for CI/CD AWS Tool 1. Maintain a code repository Commit 2. Automate the build * 3. Keep the build fast Build 4. Make the build self-testing Deploy 5. Commit early, commit often Commit 6.</description>
