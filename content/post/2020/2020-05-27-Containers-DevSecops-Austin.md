DevOps is established, and containers are all the rage, but we forget about security!

Let's talk about DevSecOps and Containers. We're going to show you how to inject security into your Container Pipelines. Don't have a pipeline? Don't worry, because we'll fix that too.

In this talk, James Strong, Cloud Native Director at Contino and AWS APN Ambassador, will share knowledge around container security and building a DevSecOps pipeline in AWS with no servers. That's right - no servers.
