One of the key values of GitOps relies on its fully declarative single source of truth in Git for the desired state of your entire system â€“ configuration that continuously reconciles with the runtime of the system.

Validating committer identity in your Git repository is a critical component towards a secure GitOps solution. Although basic capabilities are provided by Git service providers, more granular controls for governance and compliance are a requirement to satisfy most enterprise grade implementations.

How do you keep that end to end process secure, from Git to Runtime?

Join Weaveworks and Chainguard for a live webinar where we will look at how Chainguard Enforce for Git together with Weave GitOps Enterprise Policy Engine allows you to secure your end to end GitOps workflows, from Git to Runtime.

You will learn how to:

- Use Chainguard Enforce for Git to ensure only authorized GitOps tooling can modify your desired state.

- Provide a secure identity to Weave GitOps Enterprise for all Git operations.

- Use Weave GitOps Policy Engine to guarantee compliance on admission.
