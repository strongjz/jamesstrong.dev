Cosign, fulcio, rekor are all components in keyless signing with Sigstore. Each piece has its responsibility to provide a smooth developer experience for container signing. How does it all work together to complete that complicated dance to tie identity to cryptographic signatures? And what's more cryptic than rugby? In this talk, James and Lewis will educate attendees about sigstore and container signing using examples from the best sport in the world, rugby. If you're interested in learning more about sigstore and what a hooker does, this talk is for you.
