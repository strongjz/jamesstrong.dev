You are learning Kubernetes and started to face concepts like Pod CIDRs, Services, CNI, kube-proxy? Welcome! you have reached the amazing area of Kubernetes networking! We all have already been there and know how complex it may seem on the beginning, but in this talk, Ricardo and James will demystify the Kubernetes network concepts and model on a fun way, exploring how it is designed, why the is a "pause" container on every Pods, how the communication between Pods work, what are kube-proxy and CNI and their importance. In the end of this talk we expect you to get your learning path on Kubernetes Networking clear to better understand not only what are the concepts about, but also see on a live demo how every component correlates and makes the communications possible on a Kubernetes cluster.
