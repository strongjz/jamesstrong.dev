At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, [Adarsh](http://shahadarsh.com/), and I led a workshop ["Introduction to Kubernetes"](https://devnexus.com/presentations/2999/)

Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough 
understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes 
works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster & 
also hear about some war stories.
