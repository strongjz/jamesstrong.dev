Understanding the Future of Ingress-nginx - James Strong, Chainguard & Ricardo Katz, VMware

Speakers: Ricardo Katz, James Strong

In this talk, we will present the survey results from our Ingress-nginx community survey. The survey's goal was to know what we should be doing for future releases and how to prioritize features, bugs, or other issues important to the community. The ingress-nginx project is undergoing a stabilization project as well. This stabilization project has worked to increase the security, review and deprecate older features, and fix long-standing issues with the project. We will examine the current status of the stabilization project and invite community members and users to join us to discuss the future of the ingress-nginx project.
