The Chainguard team has released a new whitepaper titled “All About That Base Image.” The whitepaper proposes “quiet” base images, minimal images with few or no security vulnerabilities, and other security features built-in.

The intended audience is software development teams that use containers and are interested in reducing the workload associated with investigating and mitigating security vulnerabilities. The whitepaper helps software professionals better understand the security debt of popular base images by analyzing the number, severity, and lifetime of vulnerabilities. Joining us to discuss how Alpine is the choice for your container base image is Alpine maintainer and Chainguard Engineer, Ariadne Conill.
