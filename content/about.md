Hey Everyone! 

The Name is James Strong and I love the cloud and teaching people about it. I'm from Philadelphia, PA.
I am extremely passionate about Cloud Native tech, containers and Infrastructure. I enjoy talking to CTO's, 
junior engineers and colleagues about cloud technologies. I run 
[Kubernetes Philly CNCF Community Group](https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-philly/) and help maintain Kubernetes 
Ingress-nginx Project.

If you're interested in what I have done, checkout my [posts](/post), or [resume](/resume).

Thanks for reading, hopefully you find something helpful here!
