### O'Reilly Author - Kubernetes Networking

September 2021

Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production
scale Kubernetes network.

Understanding Kubernetes clusters is not enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack–the
network, operating system, Kubernetes–depends on the layer below. Successful administrators need to understand each
layer and how it works across deployments on-prem, in the cloud, and with managed services. Kubernetes Networking
clearly guides administrators through the layers of complexity and abstraction that come with running a Kubernetes
network. It covers:

* The Kubernetes networking model
* The CNCF Container Network Interface Project and how to choose the best interface for your clusters
* The networking and Linux primitives that power Kubernetes
* How to quickly troubleshoot networking issues and prevent downtime
* Cloud networking and Kubernetes with the three major providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure
* The pros and cons of various network tools–and how to select the best ones for your stack

### A Cloud Guru Instructor

Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a 
distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes 
on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed. With that, the demand for System, Network and 
Cluster Administrators to understand the underpinnings of the network stack in Kubernetes is ever-increasing. This 
course is a deep dive into the Kubernetes network model, the components involved and how to deploy, manage 
and troubleshoot the cluster network.
